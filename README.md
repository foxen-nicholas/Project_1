# Project_1
A game created with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

*** Introduction ***
Hello everyone! My name is Nicholas and this is my first game that I created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
I wanted to take the base dungeon crawler we were working on in class but add some more to it.

*** Goals ***
1. To get a better understanding of HTML, CSS< and Javascript through building a web based game.
2. Take orignal crawler and add items that when detected "turn off", update a counter, and when x amount is hit load a battle.
3. The next screen is a turn  based battle screen with actions to click.
4. When actions are clicked text action text will appear stating what happened
5. Have a title screen, main canvas board game, battle screen, win screen, and lose screen.

*** How it went ***

Overall, i enjoyed this project a lot and will be continuing to work on this until I feel it is complete. The main reason for this is because I feel that by doing so I will continue to get a more indepth experience with these three languages. For example, while working on this game I learn how frustrating working with canvas can be, especially when you just want to get rid of what you already drew on your canvas board. Haha. Also, I can't wait to go back and style it!! I'm excited to make this a much better looking game while using what I know and what I will learn using HTML, CSS, and Javascript. The most difficult part so far with creating this game has been learning the canvas board and the logic needed to incorporate what I wanted for that screen. The easiest part so far for me was building the battle sceen and writing out that logic. I have played a tone of RPG's in my life and I already had a bit of an understanding of how I wanted to do that screen. Next step is to add more mechnics to the battle other than just attack, magic, and rest. Thank you for your time and enjoy!

*** Instructions ***
1. For the canvas screen, use W A S D to navigate around the map.
2. For the battle screen read the text and then click on your first action.

*** My Ideas for Stretch Goals ***
1. Make it look MUCH better.
2. Add animations.
3. Add hero sprites.
4. Add sounds for when actions happen.
5. Add music.
6. Add more mechanics to the battle screen
