# Project_1
A game created with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

*** Introduction ***
Hello everyone! My name is Nicholas and this is my first game that I created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
I wanted to take the base dungeon crawler we were working on in class but add some more to it.

*** Goals ***
1. To get a better understanding of HTML, CSS< and Javascript through building a web based game.
2. Take orignal crawler and add items that when detected "turn off" and let you get to the next screen.
3. The next screen is a turn  based battle screen with actions to click.
4. When actions are clicked text action text will appear stating what happened
5. Have a title screen, main canvas board game, battle screen, win screen, and lose screen.

*** Instructions ***
1. For the canvas screen, use W A S D to navigate around the map.
2. For the battle screen read the text and then click on your first action.

*** My Ideas for Stretch Goals ***
1. Change the crawler to more like a frogger based section that when you reach the end the battle triggers.
  - or put multiple enemies to run into, each colision loads battle screen with that enemy, after battle canvas reloads without the you defeated now.
2. Make it look MUCH better.
3. Add animations.
4. Add hero sprites.
5. Add sounds for when actions happen.

*** Resources ***
1. Base canvas crawler from code along in class
